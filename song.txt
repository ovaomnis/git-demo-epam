sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their choosen battlefield

From the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're martching into destiny

Anywhere, whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone

Unconscious mind, l'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

If this night is not forever, at least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone (I know I'm not alone)
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone (I know I'm not alone)

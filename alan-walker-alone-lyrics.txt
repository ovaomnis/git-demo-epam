Lost in your mind, I wanna know
Am I losin' my mind?
Never let me go
If this night is not forever, at least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Unconscious mind, l'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away
If this night is not forever, at least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone (I know I'm not alone)
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone (I know I'm not alone)
